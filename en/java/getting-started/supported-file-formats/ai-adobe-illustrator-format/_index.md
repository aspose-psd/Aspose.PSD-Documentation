**AI, Adobe Illustrator Artwork**, represents single-page vector-based drawings in either the EPS or [PDF](https://wiki.fileformat.com/view/pdf/) formats.

The structure of an AI file depends on its version.

Aspose.PSD supports following AI versions at the moment (Full support of AI is in the product roadmap):

- AI version 3
- AI version 8



You can export an AI file of the supported version to any supported by Aspose.PSD format. For example, you can export AI file programmatically to [Psd](https://wiki.fileformat.com/image/psd/), [Png](https://wiki.fileformat.com/image/png/), [Jpeg](https://wiki.fileformat.com/image/jpeg/), [Gif](https://wiki.fileformat.com/image/gif/), [Bmp](https://wiki.fileformat.com/image/bmp/), [Tiff ](https://wiki.fileformat.com/image/tiff)file formats

Below provided sample code demonstrates how to export the AI file to PSD with File Format Manipulation API
