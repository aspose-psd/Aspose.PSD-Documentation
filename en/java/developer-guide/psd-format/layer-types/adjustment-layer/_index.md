## **Adjustment Layers Overview**
This article is intended to familiarize developers with adjustment layers API of Aspose.PSD for Java. The library already supports (v20.6 at the time of writing) the following Photoshop adjustment layers: brightness/contrast, levels, curves, exposure, hue/saturation, color balance, black & white, photo filter, channel mixer and invert. Almost all API are intuitive and easy to use. However, there are also a few of them that need more focus but donâ€™t worry they will be explained in detail further in this article.
