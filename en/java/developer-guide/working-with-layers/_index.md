## **Support of Linked Layers**
Linking layers is like grouping the layers. If you are linking two or more layers then It will allow you to make certain changes to both of the linked layers. For example, if you apply transformations to one layer then it will be applied to all other linked layers. This article demonstrates how you can get and unlink linked layers using [Aspose.PSD for Java](https://products.aspose.com/psd/java).
