## **Overview**
In Aspose.PSD for Java, you can apply various effects to layers to enhance the visual appearance of your images. These effects are facilitated through the BlendingOptions class, which offers methods to incorporate different effects such as stroke, inner shadow, drop shadow, gradient overlay, color overlay, pattern overlay, and outer glow.

To illustrate the process of applying effects to layers, let's outline the steps involved:

- Stroke: This effect entails adding a gradient stroke to a layer, specifying parameters like stroke size, gradient color points, and transparency points.

- Inner Shadow: Involves adding an inner shadow to a layer, defining attributes such as shadow angle and color.

- Drop Shadow: This effect entails adding a drop shadow to a layer, specifying parameters such as shadow angle and color.

- Gradient Overlay: Adds a gradient overlay to a layer, defining gradient color points and transparency points.

- Color Overlay: Incorporates a color overlay onto a layer, specifying the color and opacity of the overlay.

- Pattern Overlay: Entails adding a pattern overlay to a layer, defining attributes such as pattern data, width, and height.

- Outer Glow: Adds an outer glow to a layer, specifying parameters like glow size and fill color.

- After applying the desired effects to the layers, you can save the modified image in various formats.

- This description outlines the fundamental process of applying effects to layers using Aspose.PSD for Java. You can further customize these effects by adjusting their respective parameters and properties. The library offers a range of options and settings to create intricate and visually appealing effects.
