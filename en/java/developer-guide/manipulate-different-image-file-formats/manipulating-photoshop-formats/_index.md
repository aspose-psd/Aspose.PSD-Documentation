## **Color Replacement in PSD Layers**
Aspose.PSD for Java allows you to change background color of each layer of a PSD file. Please use the Aspose.PSD.FileFormats.Psd.Layers.BackgroundColor class to change layer background color in PSD layer. The following code snippet loads a PSD file, access the layer, update the background color and save the PSD file.
