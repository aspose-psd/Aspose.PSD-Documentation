## **Overview**

Adding layers to images is a common task in image editing and manipulation. With Aspose.PSD for Java, you can easily add any file as a layer to your PSD (Photoshop Document) files using a simple and straightforward API.

Aspose.PSD for Java provides a powerful set of features for working with PSD files, including layer editing capabilities. The library supports a wide range of image formats, allowing you to add layers from various file types such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and more.

To add an image file as a layer, you can use the 'add_layer' method provided by the Aspose.PSD API. This method accepts the path to the image file as input and automatically converts it into a layer that can be added to your PSD file.
