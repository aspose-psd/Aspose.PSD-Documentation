## **Overview**
Aspose.PSD allows converting [Ai](/psd/net/ai-adobe-illustrator-format/) to Jpeg, Jpeg2000, Png, Tiff, Pdf, Gif, [Psd](https://reference.aspose.com/psd/python-net/aspose.psd.fileformats.psd/psdimage) and Bmp formats.

A vector image like [Ai Image](https://reference.aspose.com/psd/python-net/aspose.psd.fileformats.ai/aiimage) is made from lines and shapes. Aspose.PSD supports the ability to render Illustrator primitives with different fill and stroke and with the custom weight, texts and other AI Format Features. 

At this moment the most AI Formats are supported

You can convert [Ai File](/psd/net/ai-adobe-illustrator-format/) on your server with [Aspose.PSD](https://products.aspose.com/psd/python-net) without Illustrator. It's a good replacement for Adobe Illustrator.
