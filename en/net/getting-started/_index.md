Aspose.PSD for .NET is On-Premise PSD Format Library that can be used to process PSD files on a server, locally without Adobe Photoshop. Aspose.PSD provides low-level PSD format API, ability to edit Fill Layers, Adjustment Layers, Text Layers, and other types of PSD Layers. It also has impressive rendering features of PSD content within .NET applications. It functions independently of other graphics applications and does not demand that an image editor is installed on the machine. Aspose.PSD allows developers to manipulate Photoshop Files within their own programs, quickly and easily. The product has the entry-level support of AI Format

The component supports the export to the most common raster file formats like Png, Jpg, Bmp, Tiff, Pdf, Gif, Jpeg2000, and adding of these formats as layers. The component allows developers to, for example, create PSD Layer, change it, Add Text Layer, and export it to the specified format. You can use low-level API to get the meta-information from PSD file Resources, such a time of layer created, or were layers merged. You can get Layer Masks, and the Raw Channel Data and change it manually. Aspose.PSD has built-in cross-platform portability. At the moment we support working in .Net Core as well.
