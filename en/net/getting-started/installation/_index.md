## **Considerations When Running on a Shared Server Environment**
All Aspose .NET components are recommended to run with Full Trust permission set. This is because Aspose .NET component sometimes need to access registry settings and files located in places other than the virtual directory e.g. for reading fonts etc. Furthermore, Aspose.NET components are based on core .NET system classes, some of which also require Full Trust permission to run in some cases.

Internet Service Providers hosting multiple applications from different companies mostly enforce Medium Trust security level. In the case of .NET 2.0, such a security level may set the following constraints which could affect the ability of Aspose.Words to perform properly.

- **RegistryPermission** is not available. This means you cannot access the registry, which is required to enumerate installed fonts when rendering documents.
- **FileIOPermission** is restricted. This means you can only access files in your application’s virtual directory hierarchy. This potentially means fonts cannot be read during export.

For these reasons specified above, it is recommended that Aspose.PSD to run on Full Trust permissions. You may find that some features of library will work when performing different tasks in Medium trust while some won't (rendering for example) which may due to calls to GDI+ image processing.


## **Working with .NET Core DLLs installed via MSI package**


**Please note:** if you use .Net Standard dll installed via MSI package you should add necessary dependencies to work with .Net Standard version.
