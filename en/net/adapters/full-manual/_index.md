## Enabling Loaders and Exportes of adaptees

### Enabling of adapters
When you need to use adapters just use the following code:
{{< gist "aspose-com-gists" "8a4c9d34ce856d1642fc7c0ce974175c" "Adapters-CSharp-Enable-Adapters.cs" >}}
 
 
### Disabling of adapters
 In the process of developement you can face situation when Adapters should be disabled. This common case if you need in one code part to use Aspose.PSD loaders and use Adaptees' Loaders in other one. In this case just use the following code:
{{< gist "aspose-com-gists" "8a4c9d34ce856d1642fc7c0ce974175c" "Adapters-CSharp-Disable-Adapters.cs " >}}

## Loading of Images using Adapters

Using adapters you can [load popular non-supported by Aspose.PSD formats]((/net/adapters/load-unsupported-formats)) like SVG or WebP.

### Simple using
Just use the following code for loading:
{{< gist "aspose-com-gists" "8a4c9d34ce856d1642fc7c0ce974175c" "Adapters-CSharp-Add-Imaging-Adapters-Loading-Unsupported-Formats.cs" >}}

### Intermediate usage for the complex Image Processing
If you need to specify additional options that are provided by Adaptee, please check the following example:
{{< gist "aspose-com-gists" "8a4c9d34ce856d1642fc7c0ce974175c" "Aspose-PSD-Adapters-CSharp-Full-Manual-Complex-Loading.cs" >}}

You can work with SVG image using all Imaging features, and then export it with one method call.

## Exporting of Images using Adapters

There are many situations when you need not to [open unsupported format](/net/adapters/load-unsupported-formats), but [export to it](/net/adapters/export-to-unsupported-formats). In this cases you should enable exporters and use the following code:
{{< gist "aspose-com-gists" "8a4c9d34ce856d1642fc7c0ce974175c" "Adapters-CSharp-Add-Imaging-Adapters-Exporting-to-Unsupported-Formats.cs" >}}
