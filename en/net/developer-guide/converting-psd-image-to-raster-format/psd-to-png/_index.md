You can specify the Png Format compression level from 0 to 9, where 9 is the highest compression. You can use Png Progressive compression and change the Color Type of the Png File.[Png Options](https://reference.aspose.com/psd/net/aspose.psd.imageoptions/pngoptions) have different properties for any cases of PSD Export.

Using the Semitransparent Png with Alpha channel for your site or work is a good solution. Adobe Photoshop file can be pixel-perfect exported with [Read-Only Mode](https://reference.aspose.com/psd/net/aspose.psd.imageloadoptions/psdloadoptions/properties/readonlymode)

Here the example of an exported PSD file with the [Applied Mask](https://docs.aspose.com/display/psdjava/Apply+Masking), [Layer with Text](https://reference.aspose.com/psd/net/aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.layers/textlayer), and Transparent [Fill Color Layer](https://reference.aspose.com/psd/net/aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.layers.filllayers/filllayer) (Aspose.PSD support all types of the [Adobe Photoshop Fill Layer](https://docs.aspose.com/display/psdjava/Support+of+Fill+Layers)). Also, you can see the [shadow effect](/psd/net/shadow-effects-in-psd-file/) on the PSD Shape Layer.
