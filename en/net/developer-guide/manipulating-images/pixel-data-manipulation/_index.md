## Introduction

Aspose.PSD is a powerful library that allows you to work with Adobe Photoshop files (PSD) in C#. In this article, we will explore how to manipulate pixel data in a PSD file using Aspose.PSD for C#.

## Overview

The provided code demonstrates how to create a PSD file, add a new layer, manipulate the pixel data directly, and save the modified image.

### Steps to Manipulate Pixel Data

1. **Importing Required Modules**:
   Import the necessary modules. You need to import the `PsdImage` and `Layer` classes from the Aspose.PSD library.

2. **Define Input and Output File Paths**:
   Specify the input and output file paths.

3. **Open the Input File as a Stream**:
   Open the input file as a stream using the `FileStream` class in read mode. Create a `PsdImage` object by loading the stream.

4. **Create a New PSD Image**:
   Create a new PSD image using the `PsdImage` constructor and provide the width and height of the layer as arguments.

5. **Assign the Layer to the PSD Image**:
   Assign the layer to the `Layers` property of the PSD image.

6. **Manipulate the Pixel Data**:
   Load the ARGB32 pixels from the layer using the `LoadArgb32Pixels` method. Define a range of indices based on the length of the pixels array and modify the pixel values as needed.

7. **Save the Modified Pixel Data**:
   Save the modified pixel data back to the layer using the `SaveArgb32Pixels` method.

8. **Save the PSD Image**:
   Save the PSD image to the output file using the `Save` method.
