## **Part 1 – Rendering a PSD File with the Warp Effect**

Photoshop saves the rendered image after applying the Warp effect. Our library can reproduce or re-render the image with the Warp effect. To enable this feature, simply set the AllowWarpRepaint flag in the settings when opening the PSD file.

In addition to rendering the Warp effect for SmartLayers, our library also supports Warp for TextLayers. The implementation code remains identical, with the only difference being in the filename.

**! Note: ** Currently, our library supports rendering both Custom Warp* (where users manipulate mesh points) and all standard Warp types.
* - Currently, our library supports Custom Warp with the standard mesh, and we are actively working on expanding our support to include all mesh types in the near future.


## **Part 2 – Modifying the Warp Effect**

Our library allows you to not only render but also modify (add) the Warp effect.
These modifications are facilitated through the features of the **WarpParams** class.

| **Feature**  | **Description**                                                         | 
|:-------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bounds       | Returns the bounds of the warped image.                                     |
| MeshPoints   | An array of points, with each point representing a vertex of the warp mesh. |
| Value        | The value of the warp effect for non-Custom warp effects.                   |
| WarpRotates  | An enumeration defining the direction of non-Custom warp effects.           |
| WarpStyles   | An enumeration defining the type of warp effect.                            |

The code example below demonstrates how to determine the type of Warp effect for a Smart Layer and adjust the type and intensity of distortion for the effect.

## Part 3 – Adding the Warp Effect**

The code example below demonstrates how to add a standard Warp effect to a Smart Layer.

The code example below demonstrates how to add a Custom Warp effect to a Smart Layer.

Result:
![Aspose.PSD for .NET Warp Result 5](warp5.png)

The code example below demonstrates how to add a Warp effect to a Text Layer. 
**! Note:** According to Photoshop's standards, the Warp effect for Text Layers is typically limited to the standard type. However, our library supports the usage of two types of Warp effects. Please note that such files may not be fully compatible with Photoshop.

We continuously refine and expand the capabilities of our Warp effect, focusing on enhancing its speed, quality, and supported functionality. Stay updated with our monthly releases for the latest developments.
