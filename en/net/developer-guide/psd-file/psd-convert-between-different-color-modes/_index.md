You can learn supported color modes of Aspose.PSD from this article.

Aspose.PSD, for example, supports conversion from 8 to 16 bit per pixel and vice versa. CMYK ICC-Profile conversions and other conversation from one type bit depth to other one. Here you can see examples of how to convert to Grayscale in PSD File.
