## **Overview**
The Graphics class gives you the ability to draw simple shapes in an instance of PsdImage or any inherited from Image class. Draws lines, rectangles, and circles, as well as complex shapes like polygons, curves, arcs, and Bezier shapes. Aspose.PSD library creates such shapes using [Aspose.PSD.Graphics](https://reference.aspose.com/psd/net/aspose.psd/graphics) class that resides in the Aspose.PSD namespace.
