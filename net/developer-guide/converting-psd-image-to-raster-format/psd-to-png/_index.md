You can specify the Png Format compression level from 0 to 9, where 9 is the highest compression. You can use Png Progressive compression and change the Color Type of the Png File.[Png Options](https://apireference.aspose.com/psd/net/aspose.psd.imageoptions/pngoptions) have different properties for any cases of PSD Export.

Using the Semitransparent Png with Alpha channel for your site or work is a good solution. Adobe Photoshop file can be pixel-perfect exported with [Read-Only Mode](https://apireference.aspose.com/psd/net/aspose.psd.imageloadoptions/psdloadoptions/properties/readonlymode)
