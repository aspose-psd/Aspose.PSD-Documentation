You can specify additional PDF meta information in [PdfOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/psd/net/aspose.psd.imageoptions/pdfoptions), like Author, Keywords, Subject, Title. Adobe Photoshop file can be pixel-perfect exported with [Read-Only Mode,](https://apireference.aspose.com/psd/net/aspose.psd.imageloadoptions/psdloadoptions/properties/readonlymode) but in this case, you will not be able to select text from [PSD Text Layers](https://apireference.aspose.com/psd/net/aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.layers/textlayer).

Batch processing of PSD files to PDF can help you to make a previewer for your website. PDF format can not be edited as a PSD file, so you can use it as an unchangeable format to work with your customers or partners and at the same moment you will have a PSD template that you can change at any time.
