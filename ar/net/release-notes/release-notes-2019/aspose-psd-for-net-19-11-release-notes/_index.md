# Missing Properties

This is an example of a markdown file with missing properties. To be a valid Hugo markdown file, it must include the following properties in the header section:

- Title: The title of the post or page.
- Type: The type of content (e.g. blog post, page, etc.).
- URL: The URL where the content will be published.

Make sure to include these properties to ensure that your markdown file is correctly formatted for Hugo.
